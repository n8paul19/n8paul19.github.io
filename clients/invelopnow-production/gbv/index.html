			<h3>How does the Business View program work?</h3>
			<p>Google trains and certifies agencies and independent photographers to perform Business View photo shoots with qualified, professional equipment.</p>

			<h3>How can Google Business View help my business?</h3>
			<p>Interior photographs are a great way to show potential customers what your business is really like. When potential customers search for your business by name on Google, they will see the images displayed directly on the search results page. These will also be published on Google+, Google My Business, Google Maps, and other Google properties and give customers a better sense of the layout, decor and beauty of your business’ interior. You can also embed or link to your Business View from your own business’ website and from your Facebook profile. Millions of users will be able to visit your establishment from the comfort of their own homes, or preview it to help them decide on a visit.</p>

			<h3>Why is Google photographing businesses? How can I see the pictures?</h3>
			<p>Photos of businesses taken by Google appointed photographers will appear in a business listing on Google Maps to help users who are looking for more information about a business and to get more visual information about the business.</p>

			<h3>Will it link to Google Street View?</h3>
			<p>If Street View is available at outside your business location we can attach your tour. Customers can travel down your street then enter inside your premises for a</p>

			<h3>What type of business is Google currently interested in photographing?</h3>
			<p>We’re photographing interiors of businesses that we know are searched for most regularly on Google Maps. The types of businesses we are currently interested in are restaurants, showrooms, retail shops, public establishments, and other storefront businesses. We’re always open to new ideas, so please let us know if you own or manage a business that people would love to see.</p>

			<h3>In which area(s) are Google Business Views available from us?</h3>
			<p>Being a Google Trusted Agency, all of our photographers are well trained and Google Certified Photographers. We currently offering Business View shoots in the St. Louis Metropolitan Area.</p>

			<h3>What will it cost to get my own Business View?</h3>
			<p>Each business and photo shoot is unique.  Please call or email us for a quote.</p>

			<h3>How long will the photo shoot take?</h3>
			<p>In most cases, a photo shoot will take about an hour, but this varies depending on the size of the business.</p>

			<h3>What do I need to do to prepare my business ahead of the photo shoot?</h3>
			<p>You are welcome to prep the space to your desire prior to the photography session, however please remember that the goal is to show customers what they would expect to see if they visited your business on a normal day.</p>

			<h3>Which areas of my businesses will be photographed?</h3>
			<p>Photo shoots will include the main customer-facing areas of your business. You can work with the photographer to determine what areas of your businesses you would like to highlight or exclude from the shoot.</p>

			<h3>Will the photo shoot disrupt my business operations?</h3>
			<p>We know you’re running a business, and that’s why we designed photo shoots to be as non-disruptive as possible. Our photographers will work around your schedule to ensure that photos are taken at a convenient time for you and your business.</p>
			<p>Photo shoots do not require any sort of special lighting or setup, so you are free to stay open. Although photo shoots are non-disruptive and should not interfere with your normal business operations, we require you to inform your customers and staff when photography is in process and request them to avoid being in view of the camera. Also, you can choose the time of the photo shoot that is most convenient for your business operations.</p>

			<h3>Will people be included in the photo shoot?</h3>
			<p>Because we want to keep the focus of the photos on the inside of your business, we aim to have as few people in the shots as possible. During the shoot, photographers may put up a sign and alert customers and employees about to be photographed. As the business owner it would be your responsibility to notify your employees and customers that the photo shoot is taking place, or to select a time of the photo shoot that is most convenient for your business operations.</p>

			<h3>What will Google appointed photographers do that I can’t do myself? <u>or</u> I already know a photographer.  Can I ask them to photograph my tour?</h3>
			<p>No. Business Views must be provided as a Google Trusted Photographers.  Google appointed photographers are specially trained to take great looking indoor 360 degree panoramic walk through pictures of your business, dealing with some of the challenges such as low lighting and tight spaces.</p>

			<h3>I’d like Google appointed photographers to take indoor pictures of my business every few months, because I keep rearranging my interiors. Is this possible?</h3>
			<p>If your business has undergone changes and if you would like to update the imagery online, we would be happy to help you and rearrange a follow-up photo shoot. The terms of the follow-up photo shoot are negotiable.</p>

			<h3>What measures are in place to ensure privacy and legal compliance?</h3>
			<p>Photo shoots will exclude any areas of your business which you would not like to feature. We are required to alert customers and employees before and during a photo session to uphold their privacy. All panoramic imagery will be processed by our state-of-the-art blurring technology to blur out faces of any employees or customers who appear in the imagery. At any time you may request additional blurring or takedown of entire images through the “Report a Problem” link at either the bottom of the panoramic image, or within your My Business Page.</p>

			<h3>Who from my business can give legal permission for the photo shoot?</h3>
			<p>You must have the proper authority to allow a Google appointed photographer access to the business premises to collect photographs and to subsequently allow Google to use those photographs in its products and services. Please note that by agreeing to all of the terms and conditions before your photo shoot, you are confirming that you have the authority to make that commitment.</p>

			<h3>Will Google be using the imagery in other applications besides My Business Pages?</h3>
			<p>Google may use these images in other products and services in new ways that will make your business information more useful and accessible to users.</p>

			<h3>Can I review the photos after they are taken and before they go live on my Place Page?</h3>
			<p>Because the imagery needs considerable processing to produce the walk-through experiences, you will not be able to review the images before they are uploaded to Google. At any time you may request additional blurring or takedown of entire images through the “Report a Problem” link at either the bottom of the panoramic image, or within your My Business Page.</p>

			<h3>Can I embed these images on my business website or Facebook profile?</h3>
			<p>Yes, we encourage you to do so. To embed the 360-degree panoramas on your website, simply find the HTML snippet from a good point-of-view of the panoramic imagery on Google Maps, click on the “Link” button , click “customize and preview embedded map,” and then copy and paste the HTML to embed in your website. If you’re looking for even more customizability with your images, check out the Google Maps API. We can help you with this if you would like assistance.</p>

			<h3>Who owns the photos taken by Google appointed photographers?</h3>
			<p>The business owner owns all the photos that are collected as part of a business photo shoot. Once your business photos are posted online you can also right click and save them directly to your computer to keep a copy for yourself.</p>

			<h3>How can I apply for a Google photo shoot of my business?</h3>
			<p>To apply for an official Google photo shoot of your business please call us or email us through our contact page, after which we will reach out to you to set up a time for our photographer to visit and take pictures. Please note that there are various factors that go into selecting businesses for the photo shoot and your business may not be eligible at this time.</p>

			<h3>Will someone from my business have to escort or help Google’s appointed photographer?</h3>
			<p>This is up to you — you may want to allocate someone to show the photographer around, especially if they will be photographing in areas that require special access or other areas where you’d like to ensure privacy.</p>

			<h3>Will I be able to select the photos used by Google?</h3>
