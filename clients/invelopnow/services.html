        <p>Invelop LLC is a locally operated company that focuses on providing best quality 3-dimensional, aerial video and and still imagery to industries and consumers in the Greater Metropolitan Area of St. Louis.  We are introducing “3-dimensional showcases” to the St. Louis Area and will provide clients with the ability to render any space – interior and/or exterior – into a 3-dimensional format that can be viewed and manipulated from any internet browser.  Combining this unique perspective of 3-dimensional views along with high definition video of external environments will allow any consumer to immerse themselves into the space to the point where they are able to translate their visual experience into the feeling of actually being at and inside the space being viewed.</p>
        
        <h3>Residential brokers:</h3>

        <p>Real Estate Professionals will find that their clients will truly appreciate the adoption of this technology. They will find that including a 3D showcase into their marketing packages will improve the ability to bring in leads and convert these leads into sales.  Sellers will appreciate the Professional's differentiation and recognition that their property is worthy of such a stunning marketing tool. Buyers will appreciate the immersive experience as they visualize themselves and their family members living in the property. A 3D showcase reduces expanded open house schedules and personal tours that waste the time of Brokers and inconveniences Sellers. Both Sellers and Brokers will appreciate the 3D showcase because the increased visibility, thus leading to a reduced time on market that benefits the Sellers and Professionals alike.</p>

        <p>Separating yourself from the ordinary is the key to success in real estate. Being the first to adopt and leverage new technology provides the best opportunity to achieve critical separation between you and the competition. A 3D showcase gives you an edge by leveraging the latest breakthroughs in computational photography and turning them into a simple and powerful buyer engagement tool.  Adding a 3D showcase to the repertoire gives the full context of every view and gives a stunning visual presentation. Now you can quickly and easily capture theproperty and create a completely immersive, interactive, photo-quality experience. The 3D showcase gives the viewer an experience that is better than being there.  Within a standard web browser, customers can see a photographic floor plan and then see the property from a completely unique, 3 dimensional floor plan view; getting a complete understanding of the layout of the property before jumping inside.</p>
        
        <p>Not only is the 3D showcase available within a matter of hours, but any number of high-quality digital photographs can be captured from the showcase and used separately in alternate marketing pieces. In addition, a guided walk-through video can also be created directly from the 3D showcase. Not only is the 3D showcase available within a matter of hours, but any number of high-quality digital photographs can be captured from the showcase and used separately in alternate marketing pieces. Because the 3D showcase is not only a photographic rendering of the property, but an electronic one as well, we will soon be adding the abilities to manipulate the showcases. For instance, upcoming features will include the ability to sign into a guestbook, take measurements, leave notes for yourself at different locations, and even virtually refresh, refurnish, or renovate the property. In addition to providing an engaging experience, you can use the 3D showcase to create a walk-through video and any number of high-quality still photographs - all from the single capture.</p>

        <h3>Commercial brokers:</h3>
        
        <p>Separation from the competition is critical in this cut-throat environment.  The inclusion of this technology into the marketing portfolio of Commercial Brokers is a revolutionary step in 21st century marketing.</p>

        <p>Many potential buyers are corporate employees and/or direct agents for said corporations, thus making the decision on whether or not to engage a particular broker or location a combined effort. Being able to offer potential buyers the ability to tour the entire space at will, not only increases transparency but also allows for potential clients to collaborate their decision making process without having to endure costly travel expenses and multiple floor-plan modeling into their budgets. 3D showcases can be applied to virtually any size commercial space. Not only is the 3D showcase available within a matter of hours, but any number of high-quality digital photographs can be captured from the showcase and used separately in alternate marketing pieces. By including additional digital processing* into the showcase(s), scanned areas can be manipulated to the point where a commercial space can have any number of items digitally inserted into the area, as many times as desired, so the potential buyer can explore multiple floor plan/build-out options without having to bear the expense of traditional architectural modeling.</p>

        <h3>Builders:</h3>

        <p>This technology is an ideal tool for the construction industry and it can benefit nearly any builder and/or construction company.  3D showcases open up a new range of possibilities for communicating with their clients and increasing new sales. Construction managers can quickly perform a 3D showcase to share project progress with clients and colleagues. Clients that are not locally available can utilize their builder's 3D showcase to make informed decisions relating to design, project status, and any purchasing decisions that require the client's visual interaction. Sub-contractors and team members can check on project status and have a much better idea of what the actual schedule is. </p>

        <p>Builders' 3D showcases are certainly not limited to residential construction. In fact, this technology yields a higher benefit to commercial builders due to the necessity to maintain a transparent project status, a cohesive team and a clear communication regimen regarding issues and project status with clients who are most often located outside of the project's geographic location. Multiple scans can be performed over the life of the project keeping the entire team on the same page with respect to the project's progress and visualization of the overall space as it is created.</p>

        <h3>Remodelers & Designers:</h3>

        <p>Remodelers can benefit from 3D showcases by allowing potential and current clients to immerse themselves into past and current projects. A completed project can almost never be toured and/or viewed by potential clients - until now. Incorporating a 3D showcase into the initial project plan will allow the remodeler to scan the remodeled area at the inception of the project, and then by completing a scan at the conclusion of the project will further aid the remodeler in having an accurate portrayal of his or her work. By producing a before, during, and after scan of the remodeled space, the Remodeler can use these scans in both an assessment of progress and a marketing tool, thus creating a double benefit to the remodeler.</p>

        <h3>Property Managers:</h3>

        <p>With respect to leasing and managing properties, following maintenance one of the largest expenditures of time and energy is related to showing potential tenants what options are available for lease.</p>

        <p>Once a 3D showcase is performed on a single family house, condominium, loft, or apartment, this 3D showcase can be perpetually stored and turned on whenever the need arises to market that unit - regardless of its occupancy and/or rehabilitation status. One full scan of a unit will last as long as the digital data will (forever) and can be viewed an infinite number of times. A 3D showcase will remove the necessity to either locate an empty unit, show an unit that is occupied, or lease an unit that cannot be toured/viewed for a variety of reasons. A 3D showcase increases the manager's ability to market and lease any unit at any time of the year.</p>

        <p>This technology can be leveraged in order to eliminate any unnecessary time gap between getting an unit ready for lease and re-leasing the unit, thus saving either the management company a penalty or saving the property's owner from additional fees and/or debt service not being supplemented by rental funds. The ability to digitally archive a showcase and turn it on at will is an immense advantage over the competition and provides any property management company a critical separation from competition.</p>

        <p>3D showcases are certainly not limited to residential property management companies.</p>

        <p>Commercial property managers can utilize 3D showcases to allow possible lessees to visualize their corporation's options without having to include costly travel expenses and multiple floor-plan modeling into their budgets. 3D showcases can be applied to virtually any size commercial space. By including additional digital processing* into the showcase(s), scanned areas can be manipulated to the point where a commercial space can have any number of items digitally inserted into the area, as many times as desired, so the potential lessee can explore multiple floor plan/build-out options without having to bear the expense of traditional architectural modeling. The inclusion of this technology into the marketing portfolio of Commercial Property Managers is a revolutionary step in 21st century marketing.</p>

        <h3>Hospitality:</h3>

        <p>There has never been a better time than now for this technology to become available. Luxury spending is the highest it has ever been, travel is easier than ever, and competition for local and international travelers is extreme. Being able to present a transparent viewpoint of a resort, a hotel, or an accommodation should put any guest at ease by offering an immersive experience before the guest physically arrives. There is no better way to present an area or a locale to the world than to allow for potential guests to experience an immersive, self-guided tour of the premises via a 3D showcase. Our team can rapidly scan a large area and have the showcase available for viewing within a matter of hours. A 3D showcase eliminates any complicated photography and videography sessions, photo/video review and selection process, and many other visual marketing options that are included in traditional marketing packages. Not only is the 3D showcase available within a matter of hours, but any number of high-quality digital photographs can be captured from the showcase and used separately in alternate marketing pieces. In addition, a guided walk-through video can also be created directly from the 3D showcase. The combination of features, the affordability of the service, and the time that is necessary to complete the above leads the hospitality industry to a very easy and singular decision.</p>
